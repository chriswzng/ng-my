            <p><strong class="highlight">ng-MY is for the people.</strong> That's it. We want every single person to
                feel safe and welcome. We want everyone to enjoy this conference to the fullest. To achieve that, we
                have defined a <strong class="highlight">Code of Conduct</strong>, an agreement in which you will take
                an active role whether you know it or not. This agreement is simple: <strong class="highlight">Be kind
                    to everyone at all times</strong> regarless of gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation,
                disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political views or experience.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2 class="page-title">Enforcement</h2>
            <p>Breaking this agreement does not take any effort, it takes ignorance, the ignorance of our greatest
                gift: <strong class="highlight">Diversity.</strong></p>
            <p>Avoid any type of harassment, sexual language or imaginery, flirting, political topics, offensive/mean
                jokes or threats. <strong class="highlight">We take violations very seriously</strong> and we reserve
                the right of expelling you from the conference and our community.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2 class="page-title">Reporting Violations</h2>
            <p>If at some point you feel that this agreement has been violated, if you feel like someone is harassing
                you, please don't think twice, <strong class="highlight">speak up</strong>, not just for you, <strong
                    class="highlight">but for others</strong> who do not have the courage to do so.</p>
            <p>Different channels will be available during the conference for you to communicate any violation. You are
                safe and we are here for you. ðŸ™‚</p>

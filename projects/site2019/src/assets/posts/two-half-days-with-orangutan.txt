Why come to Malaysia but never visit the iconic KLCC Twin Towers? If you’d like, you can shop till you drop or maybe check out cute fishies in Aquaria. 🐟 If you’re not afraid of heights, you could buy a ticket which gives you access to the Sky Bridge on the 41st floor, and the Observation Deck on the 86th floor.

Aquaria (10:00AM- 8:00PM)
